Next.js Food Delivery App
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a food delivery app I built using Next.js and MongoDB. It lets customers browse restaurants, add food to their cart, and place orders with payment options. Restaurant owners can sign up and add food items, while delivery partners handle delivering orders.

For restaurant owners:

For delivery partners:
